# casio-programs
A selection of programs from the Internet for Casio calculators.

This repo exists only in case the website where I took the programs goes down in the future.

## Disclaimer
Most of these programs can obviously be used for 'cheating' at exams.

My opinion is, if you are allowed to use a calculator for an exam, you are allowed to use it to its full potential.

I also think it's stupid to miss your exam because you miscalculated a function's derivate, or forgot that single formula that you need to complete the whole exercise.
We have computers for storage, and brains to think.

I personally use these programs to verify my answers, and not to do the exercise for me.

#### You are the only person responsible if you get caught cheating. I can't be held responsible for that.

## Programs
#### For Casio calculator (Graph 25/35+USB/75/85/95, not all models are listed):
- Casiopyt.g1a : a python implementation for Casio calculators. Create your programs on your PC and execute them on your calculator.
- Edit.g1a : a text editor for your calculator. A good way to have ... useful text on your calculator.
- Eigenmat.g1a : a formal calculus program. Allows you to derivate, integrate, factorize functions and do many other things.
- Ftune.g1a : overclocking is also for calculators ðŸ˜‰ Just beware of stability issues, it never happened with my calculator, but better be safe than sorry.
- 10216.g1m : convert binary to hexadecimal and decimal, or decimal to hexadecimal and binary.
- Proconve.g1r : a tool to convert units.
- Bmpreade.g1a : read BMP files from your calculator. Nice to have if something is hard to be represented by text only. PASCAL.bmp is a test file.

#### For PC:
- CASIO FA-124.exe : Fa-124 is a program to interface with your Casio calculator from a PC, using a mini-USB to USB cable.

## Installing a program
- g1a files are meant to be copied into the calculator's 'storage memory'. Don't copy them into the 'main memory'. These programs will be available through the main menu.
- g1m/g1r files are meant to be copied into 'main memory', These programs will be accessible through the 'program' menu.

As models aren't all the same when it comes to communication with the outside world, you can either, depending on your model:
- use a 3-pin cable to transfer the program from a friend's Casio
- use a mini-USB cable to transfer the file from your PC, thanks to the FA-124 software
- use an SD card, copy the files onto it and then copying them to the Casio's memory directly

You might have to free up some space and order the calculator to 'optimize' its storage before doing so.
