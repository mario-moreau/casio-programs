# casio-programs
A selection of programs from the Internet for Casio calculators.

This repo exists only in case the website where I took the programs goes down in the future.

## Installing a program
You just need to copy the corresponding .g1a file into the calculator's 'storage memory'. Don't copy it into the 'main memory' (anyway, you probably won't have enough space to do so).
As models aren't all the same when it comes to communication with the outside world, you can either, depending on your model:
- use a 3-pin cable to transfer the program from a friend's Casio
- use a mini-USB cable to transfer the file from your PC, thanks to the FA-124 software
- use an SD card, copy the files onto it and then copying them to the Casio's memory directly
##### There also seem to exist a 3-pin to USB cable which would allow transfers from PCs to Casios that only have a 3-pin port.

You might have to free up some space and order the calculator to 'optimize' its storage before doing so.
